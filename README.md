# Janus Keyboard ZMK Firmware

This is the firmware for the [Janus Split Keyboard](https://github.com/jsbursik/Janus-Keyboard).

I've used the [keymap editor here](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) to edit the keymap and just establish a basic setup that includes the basic keys to use it.
